    <!-- hmmmm what all do we need? 1. Who am I? 2. What do I do? 3. What have I done? 4. Somewhere eventually the updating "I learned this today" -->
    <h1>Who are you? I am Michael Wadsworth, a software developer</h1>
    <h2>What do you do? I develop software... duh.
      <span>Okay but how and why?</span>
      <span>My brain seems to love solving problems. It also loves logic. 
      So it wants to solve logical problems. Computers are full of logical problems to solve.</span></h2>
    <h3>What have you done? I've done some small projects so far. I'll link them at some point
      <a>link 1</a>
      <a>link 2</a>
      <a>link 3</a></h3>
    <h4>I really love the idea of keeping some history of "today I learned" on here. Partly so I can come back for my 
    reference, and also maybe share useful things for people like "oh dude yeah I've dealt with that check this out"</h4>
    <!-- okay how in the world do I put this all together? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, just blocks? maybe -->
    <!-- We could probably put parts 1 and 2 side by side, then block 3 full width, then block 4 after full width -->
    <!-- ooo OR block 1 and 2 take up ehhh 40% width? stacked, and then other side is block 3 OOOOO WITH TABS for "projects" and "journal" maybe??? -->
    <!-- yes I like that idea, we start there -->
