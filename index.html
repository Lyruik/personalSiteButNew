        About Me:
      </h2>
      <p>
        My brain seems to have some addiction to solving problems. It also loves
        logical thinking. I also love innovating powerful and efficient
        machines. And so, here I am, developing code and solving problems in the
        realm of beautifully logical computers. It's almost art to me really.
        With perseverance that borders obsession, I can find solutions to any
        problem (at least with enough time). With open-mindedness, I can
        collaborate with my peers and build something greater tahn any of use
        could on our own. With creativity, I can think outside of the box and
        overcome obstacles that traditional solutions cannot. Sometimes I can be
        funny too.

    <!-- okay how in the world do I put this all together? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, just blocks? maybe -->
    <!-- We could probably put parts 1 and 2 side by side, then block 3 full width, then block 4 after full width -->
    <!-- ooo OR block 1 and 2 take up ehhh 40% width? stacked, and then other side is block 3 OOOOO WITH TABS for "projects" and "journal" maybe??? -->
    <!-- yes I like that idea, we start there -->
